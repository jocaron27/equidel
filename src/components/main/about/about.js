            <p>Since arriving on the professional scene in 2000, I’ve worked hard to capture and intrigue the art community. I gather much of my inspiration from personal experiences, the environment and cultures around the world.</p>
            <p>Even though I create primarily for myself, my work has been well received by buyers and critics alike; a fact I don’t take lightly. If you would like to talk about working together, or if you have a specific project you would like to propose, please do not hesitate to <a href="./contact">contact me</a>.</p>
            <p>"Robert Caron is a traditional oil painter known for his photo realistic paintings full of vibrant colors. His sweeping nature scenes are both realistic and magical, giving one a sense of true outdoor scene combined with the feeling of something beautifully ephemeral."</p>
